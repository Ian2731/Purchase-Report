Using the purchas_data.csv I am generating a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

The report includes:

-Player Count

-Purchasing Analysis:
  (Number of Unique Items)
  (Average Purchase Price)
  (Total Number of Purchases)
  (Total Revenue)

-Gender Domographics:
  (Percentage and Count of Male Players)
  (Percentage and Count of Female Players)
  (Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed)
